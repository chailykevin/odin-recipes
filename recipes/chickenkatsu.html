            <p>Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy friend cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>
            <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken</strong>:You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
                <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stink to.</li>
                <li><strong>Panko</strong>: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
            </ul>
